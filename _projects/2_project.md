<b>Incorporating fluorescent quantum defects in the sidewalls of semiconducting SWCNTs through chemical reaction is an emerging route to predictably modify nanotube electronic structures and develop advanced photonic functionality.</b> Applications such as room-temperature single-photon emission and high-contrast bio-imaging have been advanced through aryl-functionalized SWCNTs, in which the binding configurations of the aryl group define the energies of the emitting states. However, the chemistry of binding with atomic precision at the single-bond level and tunable control over the binding configurations are yet to be achieved. In this project, we explore recently reported photosynthetic protocol and find that it can control chemical binding configurations of quantum defects, which are often referred to as organic color centers, through the spin multiplicity of photoexcited intermediates. 
<ul>
<li><b>Photochemical functionalization of SWCNTs:</b> We describe a method to introduce fluorescent quantum defects in the sidewalls SWCNTs by using photoexcited aromatic molecules as reactive agents.</li>

<li><b>Spin-state control of binding configuration:</b> We show that the presence or absence of dissolved oxygen in the reaction environment can control the binding configuration of the aryl group on the nanotube, leading to different emission energies. The oxygen-involved photoreaction activates ortho binding configurations via a singlet-state pathway, while the oxygen-free photoreaction enables para binding configurations via a triplet-state pathway.</li>

<li><b>Low-temperature spectroscopy and DFT simulations:</b> We use low-temperature single-nanotube photoluminescence spectroscopy to characterize the emission features of different SWCNT chiralities functionalized by the photochemical method. We also perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations to model the band gaps and reaction pathways of the functionalized SWCNTs. We find good agreement between the experimental and theoretical results and rationalize the mechanism of the spin-selective photochemistry.</li>

<li><b>Implications and significance:</b> We demonstrate that the photochemical functionalization of SWCNTs provides a precise and tunable way to create fluorescent quantum defects with specific binding configurations and emission wavelengths. We also suggest that the concept of spin-state control can be extended to other nanomaterials and conjugated systems. We highlight the potential applications of the functionalized SWCNTs as quantum light sources and sensors.</li>
