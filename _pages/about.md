Hi, thank you for  stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at North Dakota State University (NDSU).  My current research interest is focused on simulations of photoexcitation processes, phonon-assisted dynamics, and transport properties in novel nano-structured materials, such as quantum dots and carbon nanotubes, using quantum ab initio and machine learning techniques. 

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Materials Chemistry from The University of South Dakota (USD).  I worked on the synthesis and characterization of ionic liquids and inorganic nanoparticles, luminescence properties of lanthanides by laser spectroscopy, coordination environments of lanthanides in ionic liquids through crystallographic models, and photofragmentation mechanisms of metal-organic compounds during laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition using time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
