	abstract = {One of the potentially transformative areas of scientific development is to achieve superconductivity at room temperature. Recently, the photochemical synthesis was carried out to prepare carbonaceous sulfur hydride (CSH) systems with room-temperature superconductivity at high pressure. In this work, we present a first-principles study aiming to unravel the photoreaction of sulfur with molecular hydrogen using the time-dependent excited-state molecular dynamics (TDESMD) methodology. Individual TDESMD trajectory provides details about reactions that lead to a number of allotropes of sulfur and their hydrogenated forms. Simulated mass spectra based on an ensemble of TDESMD trajectories provide the distribution of sulfanes along reaction pathways. It is found that the photoreaction starts with ring opening of cyclic S8, which may then react with two H radicals to form S8H2 as a result of the homolytic dissociation of H2. The sulfur cluster will undergo the elimination of small fragments, which can later recombine into a variety of sulfanes. The most abundant fragments generated along trajectories are H2S, S4H2, and S8H2. The final sulfur-bearing products are a mixture of sulfanes with various chains and rings. The mechanistic and conformational information obtained from this work allows us to better understand the photoreaction, and potentially, give insights into the preparation of high Tc materials using similar reactants.},

In this study, we present the results of modeling the electronic and optical properties of Ce-containing LBBF structures where doping atoms are located at different sites of the host lattice. We also consider the presence of F-centers, which exhibit trap states located within the band gap. We further investigate the nonadiabatic excited state electronic dynamics to elucidate electron-relaxation pathways. The nonadiabatic couplings (NACs) calculations provide transition probabilities facilitated by the nuclear movement. The relaxation rates of electrons and holes are calculated using Redfield’s theory of the formalism of the reduced density matrix (RDM). The PL spectra are calculated using molecular dynamics (MD) sampling and time-integrated methods along the excited state trajectory based on NACs. Mechanisms of PL in LBBF:Ce3+ crystals are interpreted using both computational and experimental observations. This work illustrates the dependence of transition energies, intensities, and relaxation rates of Ce-containing LBBF crystals on a selection of doping sites. In addition to analysis of emission band contributed by cerium, this work allows to identify and reproduce spectral lines hypothetically corresponding to the interband and intraband transitions in F-centers of borate crystals, available in the absence of a metal center.},

	abstract = {Incorporating fluorescent quantum defects in the sidewalls of semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) through chemical reaction is an emerging route to predictably modify nanotube electronic structures and develop advanced photonic functionality. Applications such as room-temperature single-photon emission and high-contrast bio-imaging have been advanced through aryl-functionalized SWCNTs, in which the binding configurations of the aryl group define the energies of the emitting states. However, the chemistry of binding with atomic precision at the single-bond level and tunable control over the binding configurations are yet to be achieved. Here, we explore recently reported photosynthetic protocol and find that it can control chemical binding configurations of quantum defects, which are often referred to as organic color centers, through the spin multiplicity of photoexcited intermediates. Specifically, photoexcited aromatics react with SWCNT sidewalls to undergo a singlet-state pathway in the presence of dissolved oxygen, leading to ortho binding configurations of the aryl group on the nanotube. In contrast, the oxygen-free photoreaction activates previously inaccessible para configurations through a triplet-state mechanism. These experimental results are corroborated by first principles simulations. Such spin-selective photochemistry diversifies SWCNT emission tunability by controlling the morphology of the emitting sites.},

The computational results are presented for electronic density of states, absorption spectra, charge carrier dynamics, and photoluminescence (PL) by comparing various spin multiplicities. Results on spin α and spin β components are independent and quite different because of the partial occupation of Fe 3d states. Overall, HS is the most stable with the largest Fe–O distances.

  	abstract = {Mechanisms of photoluminescence in antizeolite fluoride borates (AFBs) doped by copper ions are interpreted based on a comparison between experimental and computational approaches. Doped AFBs demonstrate the effect of thermally stimulated photoluminescence and hold a promise for the use as radiation detectors. AFBs are built of porous framework [Ba12(BO3)6]6+ with channels along the c axis. Lattice channels can accommodate various guest anionic groups. In this study, we present the results of modeling the electronic and optical properties of Cu-containing fluoride borates with [Cu(OH)4]3– (monovalent Cu) and [Cu(OH)6]4– (divalent Cu) as anionic groups. It is found that monovalent Cu+ ions create occupied Cu-3d states near the top of the valence band, whereas divalent Cu2+ ions create vacant Cu-3d states near the bottom of the conduction band. These states can serve as traps for electronic excitations and affect both the linear absorption and photoluminescent (PL) properties. PL spectra calculations were performed using two ab initio methodologies: (i) molecular dynamics (MD) sampling and (ii) time integration along with the progression of subsequently occupied excited states. The results show that the theoretical PL spectra calculated at a temperature of 10 K are instrumental in interpretation of experimental data obtained at 77 K. This effect is due to the strong dependence of Cu–OH distances in anionic groups along MD trajectories at given temperatures, which, in addition, manifests itself in the temperature dependence of the times and relaxation paths of electronic excitations. The results obtained open the way to designing new materials with predetermined properties for applications in radiation detectors based on thermally stimulated photoluminescence.},

	abstract = {A theoretical treatment based on the equations of motion of an electronic reduced density matrix, and related computational modeling, is used to describe and calculate relaxation times for nanostructured TiO2(110) surfaces, here for Ag and Ag2 adsorbates. The theoretical treatment deals with the preparation of a photoexcited system under two different conditions, by steady light absorption with a cutoff and by a light pulse, and describes the following relaxation of electronic densities. On the computational modeling, results are presented for electronic density of states, light absorbance, and relaxation dynamics, comparing results for Ag and Ag2 adsorbates. The aim of this work is to provide insight on the dynamics and magnitude of relaxation rates for a surface with adsorbed open- and closed-shell Ag species to determine whether the advantages in using them to enhance light absorbance remain valid in the presence of charge density relaxation. Different behaviors can be expected depending on whether the adsorbate particles (Ag metal clusters in our present choice) have electronic open-shell or closed-shell structures. Calculated electron and hole lifetimes are given for pure TiO2(110), Ag/TiO2(110), and Ag2/TiO2(110). The present results, while limited to chosen structures and photon wavelengths, show that relaxation rates are noticeably different for electrons and holes, but comparable in magnitude for pure and adsorbate surfaces. Overall, the introduction of the adsorbates does not lead to rapid loss of charge carriers, while they give large increases in light absorption. This appears to be advantageous for applications to photocatalysis.},

We next assess the influence of the phenyl groups on photophysics of hydrogen-terminated Si(111) slabs. The nonadiabatic couplings necessary for a description of the excited-state dynamics are calculated by combining ab initio electronic structures and reduced density matrix formalism with Redfield theory. The phenyl-terminated slab shows reduced nonradiative relaxation and recombination rates of hot charge carriers in comparison with the hydrogen-terminated slab. Altogether, our results provide atomistic insights revealing that (i) the diazonium salt thermally decomposes at the surface allowing the formation of covalently bonded phenyl group, and (ii) the coverage of phenyl groups on the surface slows down charge carrier cooling driven by electron–phonon interactions, which increases photoluminescence efficiency at the near-infrared spectral region.},

	abstract = {Metal–organic frameworks/materials (MOFs/MOMs) are advanced enzyme immobilization platforms that improve biocatalysis, materials science, and protein biophysics. A unique way to immobilize enzymes is co-crystallization/co-precipitation, which removes the limitation on enzyme/substrate size. Thus far, most enzyme@MOF composites rely on the use of non-sustainable chemicals and, in certain cases, heavy metals, which not only creates concerns regarding environmental conservation but also limits their applications in nutrition and biomedicine. Here, we show that a dimeric compound derived from lignin, 5,5′-dehydrodivanillate (DDVA), co-precipitates with enzymes and low-toxicity metals, Ca2+ and Zn2+, and forms stable enzyme@Ca/Zn–MOM composites. We demonstrated this strategy on four enzymes with different isoelectric points (IEPs), molecular weights, and substrate sizes. Furthermore, we found that all enzymes displayed slightly different but reasonable catalytic efficiencies upon immobilization in the Ca–DDVA and Zn–DDVA MOMs, as well as reasonable reusability in both composites. We then probed the structural basis of such differences using a representative enzyme and found enhanced restriction of enzymes in Zn–DDVA than in Ca–DDVA, which might have caused the activity difference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first aqueous-phase, one-pot synthesis of a lignin-derived “green” enzyme@MOF/MOM platform that can host enzymes without any limitations on enzyme IEP, molecular weight, and substrate size. The different morphologies and crystallinities of the composites formed by Ca–DDVA and Zn–DDVA MOMs broaden their applications depending on the problem of interest. Our approach of enzyme immobilization not only improves the sustainability/reusability of almost all enzymes but also reduces/eliminates the use of non-sustainable resources. This synthesis method has a negligible environmental impact while the products are non-toxic to living things and the environment. The biocompatibility also makes it possible to carry out enzyme delivery/release for nutritional or biomedical applications via our “green” biocomposites.},

Our calculations provide relaxation rates and relaxation pathways, illustrating the mechanisms of modulations of electric field strengths onto charge carrier dynamics. Our results show that holes have longer lifetimes than electrons at various external electric fields.

The thin film samples were made at ambient pressure using the common liquid-phase synthesis, but samples were degassed under UHV. We studied real-world samples which do have some carbon impurities. Adsorption and decomposition kinetics were characterized with thermal desorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, samples’ composition (including impurities) were inspected under UHV with Auger electron spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Accordingly, formic acid adsorbs molecularly at 100 K but decomposed above 600 K. On ITO or thermally decomposed perovskite samples, formic acid adsorbs only molecularly. The gas-phase species detected are consistent with a decomposition mechanism via the formation of formate (HCOO) and formyl (HCO) intermediates. The perovskite itself also decomposed thermally, but it is stabilized to some extent by the adsorbed formic acid. In addition, density functional theory calculations (DFT) were used to characterize the molecular adsorption pathway of HCOOH as well as the adsorption of various decomposition fragments. Accordingly, molecular formic acid adsorption is facilitated by a Pb–O bond formation between a 5-fold coordinated Pb atom on the surface of the perovskite and the carbonyl O atom of formic acid. Residual water and CO2, present due to the ambient pressure sample synthesis, stabilize molecular formic acid by forming a strong complex with water and weaker bonds with CO2.},

	abstract = {Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) exhibit unique optoelectronic properties originating from one-dimensional confinement effect. Technologically relevant properties—including band gap, radiative and nonradiative transitions, and charge carrier relaxation rates—are influenced by sampling of momentum along the growth direction. In this work, we quantify the influence of momentum dispersion on hot-electron relaxation rates and nonradiative lifetimes for SiNWs with ⟨100⟩ and ⟨111⟩ growth directions. Specifically, we account for nonradiative transitions between electronic states with different momentum, where changes in energy and momentum are achieved via interaction with a thermal bath of nuclear degrees of freedom. Photoexcited dynamic processes in reference SiNWs are computed via “on-the-fly” nonadiabatic couplings between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom based on density functional theory (DFT). The dynamics of electronic degrees of freedom is propagated by a Redfield equation of motion for the reduced density matrix. Our results show that transitions allowing change of momentum prompt electron relaxation faster than those not allowing change of momentum. Our study also indicates that the electron relaxation time in ⟨100⟩ SiNW is longer than that in ⟨111⟩ SiNW.},

Two competing reaction pathways, intact ligand stripping and ligand cracking within the metal–ligand complex, were hypothesized based on experimental data. It was evident that intramolecular hydrogen, methyl, and isopropyl abstraction play an important role in the ligand-cracking reaction pathway, leading to metal carbide and metal hydrocarbide products. The TDESMD simulations also produced branching reaction pathways for ligand ejection and ligand cracking and further suggested that both pathways are initiated by ligand-to-metal charge transfer.
